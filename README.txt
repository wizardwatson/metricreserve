Metric Reserve
by wizardwatson

Metric Reserve is a native Google App Engine application 
designed to provide banking services for whatever currency 
or currencies you want to use.  The fancy-schmancy thing
that makes it different than a typical ledger based payment
or currency system is that it implements an algorithm for
determining graph connectedness and also an algorithm to
suggest reserve distributions in a arbitrary graph.
